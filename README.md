## ⚙️ How to Run the Application

🛢️ Database Configuration

The application uses MySQL for storing data. Update the application.properties or application-dev.properties file in the backend directory with your database details:


      spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&useSSL=true&serverTimezone=UTC
      spring.datasource.username=your_username
      spring.datasource.password=your_password

### Backend (Spring Boot)
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd Back-end/inventory-managment-system

Build the backend using Gradle:

      ./gradlew build

Run the backend:

    java -jar build/libs/inventory-managment-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Ensure that your MySQL database is running and configured as per the application.properties or application-dev.properties files.

Frontend (Angular)

   Navigate to the frontend directory:


      cd Front-end_v16/InventoryMangmentSystem

Install dependencies:

      npm install

Run the frontend:

    ng serve

Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:4200.



🖥️ Deployment
Backend Deployment

      Deploy the generated .jar file to your server.
      Make sure the database is properly configured and accessible.

Frontend Deployment

Build the Angular application:

    ng build --prod

      Host the contents of the dist/ folder on a web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache).
